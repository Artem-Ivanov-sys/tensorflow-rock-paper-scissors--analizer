## Introduction

This is project I made within the framework of Google specialization TensorFlow developer.
There are 2 Python programs:
  - `index.pyw` is a **Tkinter** interfase that allows you to load an image of your hand and determines neither this is rock or paper or scissors
  - `CameraCapture.pyw` is a program that uses **OpenCV** library to capture your webcam and to do the same think but in real time

Photos for testing the `index.pyw` you can find in `Img\` folder.
`CameraCapture.pyw` will use your first webcam.
